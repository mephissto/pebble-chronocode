# pebble-chronocode

**NOTE:** Requires Pebble Firmware v2.0 or greater.

## Description

ChronoCode (formerly known as WordSquare) displays the current time by emphasizing words "hidden" among a jumble of seemingly random letters. The time is displayed in sentence form, e.g. "It is five o'clock", "It is half past three", "It is a quarter to nine", etc. The watchface is configurable via the Pebble app on your smartphone. Options include inverted colors, all-caps mode, and 8 different languages.

### Extended Description

ChronoCode is a watchface app for the Pebble Smartwatch that fills the screen with a sequence of characters, which, at first glance, may appear to be completely random. However, all of the words required to display the current time appear somewhere in the jumbled mess of characters. The current time (to the nearest five minute interval) is designated by emphasizing the words needed to create a sentence that one might use to say the time, e.g. "It is eight o'clock" or "It is a quarter past three". For a more precise time, the watchface displays a small box/dot in one of the corners of the screen with each corner representing one minute before/after the current five minute interval. The top-left corner represents one minute, the top-right corner two minutes, the bottom-right corner three minutes and the bottom-left corner four minutes. Using these corner markers, it is possible to discern the time down to the nearest one minute interval.

The app is configurable via the Pebble smartphone app. See Options section below for more details.

## Install

To install this watchface onto your Pebble device using your phone's browser, go to the [downloads page](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5580297bda86937b5c00001c).

## Use

The current time is displayed (to the most recent five-minute interval) in sentence form. Four dots are shown in the corners of the screen to represent 1 (top-left), 2 (top-right), 3 (bottom-left), and 4 (bottom-right) minutes past the five-minute inerval.

### Options

* All Caps
    Toggles "ALL CAPS" mode in which all letters are displayed in their capitalized (upper-case) state.

* Inverted
    Toggles inverted mode in which the colors of the display are inverted, i.e. black becomes white and white becomes black.

* ±2 Minute Dots
    Toggles "±2 minute dots" mode in which the watch changes behavior to display the nearest five-minute interval as opposed to the most recent five-minute interval. For example, 4:02 would still be displayed as "It is two o'clock," but 4:03 would be displayed as "It is five past two" as 4:03 is nearer to 4:05 than 4:00. In this mode, the four dots shown in the corners of the screen represent -1 (top-left), -2 (top-right), +1 (bottom-left), and +2 (bottom-right) minutes before or after the current five-minute interval. The earlier example of 4:02 would have the bottom-right dot displayed, while 4:03 would have the top-right dot displayed. This mode is a bit confusing at first if the user is accustomed to the "normal" display, but it is actually a more accurate display of the current time.

* Language
    One of eight languages can be chosen for the watchface display. Available languages include:
      - English (en_US)
      - Belgisch-Nederlands (nl_BE)
      - Dansk (da_DK)
      - Deutsch (de_DE)
      - Español (es_ES)
      - Français (fr_FR)
      - Italiano (it_IT)
      - Nederlands (nl_NL)
      - Português (pt_PT)
      - Svenska (sv_SE)

2. Build the project:

    `$ pebble build`

3. Install the compiled project to your Pebble:

    `$ pebble install --phone [your_phone_ip_here]`

## Adding new translations

__NOTE__: _Very bare bones instructions here. I really need to provide a translation template file with plenty of good comments to assist with the creation of new translation files. Also, the whole process of creating new translations could be vastly improved._

* Create a new translation file named `chronocode.xx_XX.c`, where xx_XX is the locale code for the language. The locale code is comprised of the two-letter [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code followed by an underscore character (`_`) followed by the two-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country/region code.
* Add a line to `cclp/src/cclp.c` to include the new translation file. Ensure all other translation file includes are commented out.
* Run `make` to create a new cclp binary.
* Run `cclp` to create a new `packed` file.
* Copy the `packed` file to `resources/l10n/chronocode.xx_XX.cclp`.
* Build ChronoCode as described above.
